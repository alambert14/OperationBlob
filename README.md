You have been chosen to take care of a blob, a fun, playful creature who comes from a mystical land.  You take care of your blob by typing certain commands...

feed (meat, fruit, or vegetable) --- Feeds your blob and happiness goes up and your blob becomes more full. Every 4 times you feed your blob, your blobs bladder becomes full. Meat costs 30 "monies", fruits and veggies cost 15.
play --- Plays with your blob, happiness goes up.
bathe --- Cleans your blob, cleanliness becomes 100%.
walk --- Takes your blob on a walk, bladder is emptied.
compete --- Enters your blob in a competition. Your blob wins based on its stats.  It does not cost "monies" to enter, but if you loose, you loose 50 "monies". This is the gambling aspect of the game...if you run out of money it is game over.
buy blob --- Buys a friend for your blob to play with!  It makes it become happier.  Costs 1000 monies.

info --- Prints all of your blobs stats (Name, color, age, hunger, cleanliness, happiness, bladder level).
monies --- Prints how many "monies" you have.
close --- Terminates the program.

As you can see, the goal of this game is to keep your blob happy...without running out of "monies" (the Blob currency). This takes strategy and a little bit of gambling. Check your blob's stats often...it will help.

When the game starts, you will be asked to name your blob and set its color. You can name your blob whatever you choose, but its color must be one of the following:

Red
Orange
Yellow
Green
Blue
Purple
Magenta
Pink
White
Black

Over time, your blob's hunger will increase, and its cleanliness and happiness will decrease. You need to continue to care for your blob.  

Also, random events may occur...
Your blob may get sick (-50 strength for a certain amount of time) or some monetary surprises may occur. 

If your blob becomes too neglected, it is a game over.  Remeber to take care of your blob, it is counting on you!
